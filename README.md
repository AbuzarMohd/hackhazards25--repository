# 🚀 Project Title

> NutriNavigator: Personalized Diet, Restaurant & Workout Recommendations Using AI
---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Problem Dtatement 1 - Weave AI eith Groq
Build a creative and interactive multimodal application powered by Groq, leveraging its capabilities to solve real-world problems with a focus on user experience and innovation
---

## 🎯 Objective

This project addresses the challenge of managing personalized health, diet, and fitness goals in a fast-paced world where one-size-fits-all solutions often fall short. It serves health-conscious individuals, especially those with specific medical conditions, allergies, or dietary restrictions, by offering intelligent, hyper-personalized guidance.
Imagine a user with diabetes, a gluten allergy, and a preference for South Indian cuisine. Instead of manually researching recipes or restaurants, the assistant instantly creates a customized meal plan, recommends nearby dining options, and provides a fitness routine aligned with their health profile. By leveraging LLaMA 3 on Groq Cloud, the system delivers lightning-fast, intelligent suggestions, making health management seamless, accessible, and tailored to real-life needs.

### Your Approach:  

---

**Why we chose this problem:** 
We saw a gap in truly personalized health and diet support—most apps are generic, slow, or require too much manual input. With rising health awareness and diverse dietary needs (e.g., PCOS, gluten intolerance, cultural preferences), we wanted to create an assistant that feels like a real coach, not just a food tracker.



**Key challenges we addressed:**  
- **Hyper-personalization at scale:** Building logic that adapts to each unique user profile while staying fast and relevant.  
- **Real-time regional suggestions:** Integrating local data (like nearby restaurants) and matching it with dietary restrictions.  
- **Balancing health and taste:** Ensuring meal and workout suggestions are not only healthy but enjoyable and culturally familiar.  
- **Speed + intelligence:** Using LLaMA 3 on Groq Cloud to handle complex reasoning *without* sacrificing performance.



**Pivots, brainstorms, or breakthroughs:**  
Early on, we realized just generating a meal plan wasn’t enough—users wanted context. So we added reasoning behind recommendations ("why this food/why this workout"). A key breakthrough was designing modular inputs (e.g., allergies, medical conditions, cuisine style) that flow into one seamless experience. Using Groq’s ultra-fast inference unlocked the power to deliver this interactively in real time.
